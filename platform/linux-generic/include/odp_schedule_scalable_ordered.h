/* High level functioning of reordering
 * Datastructures -
 * Reorder Window - Every ordered queue is associated with a reorder window.
 *                  Reorder window stores reorder contexts from threads that
 *                  have completed processing out-of-order.
 * Reorder Context - Reorder context consists of events that a thread
 *                   wants to enqueue while processing a batch of events
 *                   from an ordered queue.
 *
 * Algorithm -
 * 1) Thread identifies the ordered queue.
 * 2) It 'reserves a slot in the reorder window and dequeues the
 *    events' atomically. Atomicity is achieved by using a ticket-lock
 *    like design where the reorder window slot is the ticket.
 * 3a) Upon order-release/next schedule call, the thread
 *     checks if it's slot (ticket) equals the head of the reorder window.
 *     If yes, enqueues the events to the destination queue till
 *         i) the reorder window is empty or
 *         ii) there is a gap in the reorder window
 *     If no, the reorder context is stored in the reorder window at
 *     the reserved slot.
 * 3b) Upon the first enqueue, the thread checks if it's slot (ticket)
 *     equals the head of the reorder window.
 *     If yes, enqueues the events immediately to the destination queue
 *     If no, these (and subsequent) events are stored in the reorder context
 *     (in the application given order)

/* Head and change indicator variables are used to synchronise between
 * concurrent insert operations in the reorder window. A thread performing
 * an in-order insertion must be notified about the newly inserted
 * reorder contexts so that it doesnâ€™t halt the retire process too early.
 * A thread performing an out-of-order insertion must correspondingly
 * notify the thread doing in-order insertion of the new waiting reorder
 * context, which may need to be handled by that thread.
 *
 * Also, an out-of-order insertion may become an in-order insertion if the
 * thread doing an in-order insertion completes before this thread completes.
 * We need a point of synchronisation where this knowledge and potential state
 * change can be transferred between threads.
